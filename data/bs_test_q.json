The two are mixed in the valve and will either go up to the shower head or down to a tub spout. A diverter directs which way the water goes. Because your new faucet is designed to work in a specific brand of valve, there's a good chance you'll have to install a new valve in the wall whenever you install a new shower faucet. To do that, you'll need to gain access to the plumbing inside the wall by removing the section of drywall around the current valve. New trim kits for your brand of faucets are often available. These allow you to change the look of your bathroom without replacing the valve behind the wall, but the selection of styles is limited. .
